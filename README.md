# passwordGenerator
The purpose of this application is for a user to get a randomly generated password based on selection criteria.

# description
The password generator is for people who want a very secure password that is also customised based on what the user wants.
For example, the user may or may not include in their password if they want: 
- special characters
- upper case characters
- lower case characters
- numbers

The user can choose the length of the password, but it must be between 8 - 128 characters.

This password can also be saved to the clipboard.
